## I have read this usefull article and I would like to share it with you :
<br>
The article explains how to be a creative and professional programmer through a couple of important points:<br>
1- Understand the program well to reduce complexity and make the program more useful.<br>
2- Designing the website in a smart and easy way to facilitate your work as a programmer .<br>
3- (Mis)understanding the application will make the program bad and not useful
" Understanding is the key difference between a bad developer and a good developer."— Max Kanat-Alexander <br>
4- Simplify the code as much as possible to make it easier for other programmers to understand.
Complexity has nothing to do with intelligence, simplicity does. — Larry Bossidy <br>
5-Reduce the amount of complexity in the program as much as possible,Your main purpose is to control complexity, not to create it. <br>
6- One of the most important points is the maintenance , as every change may require maintenance, and that helps reduce complexity.<br>
7-The consistency of the program must be maintained to make understanding code much easier . Variables and files must be named correctly,with making sure that the names are not changed. <br>
8- Focus on priorities by choosing the option which has the least effort and most valuable <br>
9- If you problems , you have to understand the problem well and plan how to solve it and then it will be solved easily. <br> 
10- Good is enough , you don't need to make the program perfect that will make it more complicated (Start small, improve it, then extend). <br>
11- You don't have to predict the future, just work in general to reduce the complexity of the program as much as possible<br>
12- you have to avoid assumptions just do what do you know , Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future. —  Code Simplicity<br>
13- Do not reinvent , If there is already a good and easy-to-use program, do not reinvent it<br>
14- Resist adding more code as long as it is not needed<br>
15- If you can automate repetitive tasks, then do it <br>
16- don't measure your code و A lot of code does not mean that the program is good. The simpler the code, the more professional the program<br>
17- Productivity , just by making your code as simple as you can. <br>
18- Test your code line by line to reduce errors as much as possible<br>
19- Divide the work into small parts to appreciate it better<br>
20- don't rewrite the code just start from scratch that will be much easier <br>
21-Adding comments and documents to the program will make it easier for other programmers to understand your code, but you have to keep the comments saying why you added it and not what it does<br>
22- You should stay away as much as possible from using  external resources (tools, librarires,etc..) because it will increase the complexity <br>
23- You have to develop yourself and always learn new things and know that each problem has its own way of solving it<br>
24- Don't be a hero and don't be shy to ask for help <br>
25- Don’t Ask Questions… Ask For Help , first of all try to solve the problem by yourself if you didn't then search if you didn't find a solution then ask for help .<br>
